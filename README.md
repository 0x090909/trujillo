# Trujillo

Trujillo is an experimental software that combines IPFS and Apache to serve static content on the web as a Content Delivery Network.

The current theoretical configuration is as follows: 

## WEB <-----> Apache 2 <-----> IPFS
Apache 2 works as a reverse proxy between the web user and IPFS.
